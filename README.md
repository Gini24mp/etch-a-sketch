# Etch A Sketch-My Sketchpad Project

## Introduction

During this project, I challenged myself to create a browser version of a sketchpad, inspired by both traditional sketchpads and Etch-A-Sketch toys. This project aimed to enhance my DOM manipulation skills, requiring me to dynamically generate a grid of squares and implement hover effects using JavaScript and CSS.

## Implementation

To complete the project, I followed these steps:

1. **Git Repository Setup**: I started by creating a Git repository to track my progress and collaborate effectively.
  
2. **Grid Generation**: Using JavaScript, I created a webpage containing a 16x16 grid of square divs. Rather than hardcoding the divs in the HTML file, I generated them dynamically to improve efficiency and maintainability.

3. **Hover Effect**: I implemented a hover effect using JavaScript to change the color of the grid divs when the mouse cursor passed over them. This feature simulated the experience of drawing on the sketchpad.

4. **New Grid Button**: I added a button at the top of the screen to prompt users to input the number of squares per side for a new grid. Upon entering the value, the existing grid was removed, and a new grid with the specified dimensions was generated while preserving the total space.

5. **GitHub Push**: Once the project was completed, I pushed my code to GitHub to share my work and showcase my progress.

## Conclusion

This project provided an excellent opportunity to apply and strengthen my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and DOM manipulation. By overcoming challenges and exploring additional features, I gained valuable experience and knowledge that will benefit me in future projects. I'm proud of the outcome and excited to continue learning and improving my development skills.
